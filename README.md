# todays-colour

a website/net.art piece where the hex code corresponds with the date, with the colour itself being the only thing on the site (the hex code itself will tell the user the date through the hex code, so 22/03/21 becomes #220321 and so on). it will (hopefully) be automatically updated everyday to reflect the next date and will go on forever.
